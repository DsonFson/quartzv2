- The generic  definition of electric field 
	- a region of space in which charged particles are subject to  an electrostatic force 
- An electric field can be described as a vector quantity since 
	- It is the force per unit charge exerted on  a test charge at any point 
	- ie. F = Eq, E= F/q
- Charges are quantized. What does this mean?
	- Every observable amount of electric charge is an integer multiple of a basic unit. (eg. Cash can't be divided into amounts smaller than one cent, the basic unit is 1 cent. Likewise, charges can't go smaller than the charge of one electron/proton

- An electric field can result from two forces,
	- An electrostatic force, and a non-electrostatic force
	- What does force have to do with electric field?
		- Every charged particle will experience a force within an electric field, whether electrostatic or non-electrostatic.
- Coulomb's law, in words,  states that
	- The magnitude of the electric force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
- The symbolic formula for Coulomb's law is 
	- $F = k\frac{|q_{1}q_{2}|}{r^{2}}$
- The value of Coulomb's constant is 
	- $9.0 \times 10^{9}$
- The units for Coulomb's constant is 
	- $\frac{Nm^{2}}{C^{2}}$
- The electric potential V, near **a point charge**, Q, at a distance r is given by the formula 
	- $$V=\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}$$
	- since W = Fd=Fr( r=d,both symbols mean distance), and $F = k\frac{|q_{1}q_{2}|}{r^{2}}$ and, we divide both sides
- The work W done by the electric force on a charged particle moving in an electric field can be represented by
	- The change in a potential-energy function U
	- $$U=\frac{qq_{0}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}$$
- The electric potential energy for a single charge in the presence of a collection of charges is represented by the equation 
	- $$U=\frac{q_{0}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}(\frac{q_{1}}{r_{1}} + \frac{q_{2}}{r_{2}} + \frac{q_{3}}{r_{3}} + ...) $$ 
	- Here $q_{0}$ is the charge focused on that is in the presence of other point charges

- The $\epsilon_{0}$ is called 
	- the permittivity of free space 
	- It describes
		- the capability of the classical vacuum to permit the electric field
	- It has a definite defined value of 
		- $8.85\times10^{-12}$
- The units are 
	- $Fm^{-1}$
- the constant k in Coulomb's law is called Coulomb's constant and is equal to $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}$. 
- The electrical potential, V, at a point in an electrical field is the work done in moving a unit positive charge from infinity (V=0) to that point within the electric field.
